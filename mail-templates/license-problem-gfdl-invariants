Hi,

Your package includes some files (see below) licensed under GFDL with invariant or front-cover or back-cover texts.

{list of files}

Per General Resolution [1] GFDL with invariant or front-cover or back-cover text is considered non-free.

You could solve this problem by (see also [2]):
- contact upstream to relicense.
- rip the file and add it to non free (like gcc-doc).

You could also ask debian-qa for more guidance.

Thanks
