Hi!

This source package contains the following files from the
IETF under non-free license terms:

{list of files}

The license on RFC/I-Ds is not DFSG-free, see:

 * https://wiki.debian.org/NonFreeIETFDocuments
 * https://bugs.debian.org/199810

According to the squeeze/wheezy release policy, source packages must be
DFSG-free, see:

 * https://release.debian.org/squeeze/rc_policy.txt
 * https://release.debian.org/wheezy/rc_policy.txt

The severity is serious, because this violates the Debian policy:

 * https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/#s-dfsg

There are (at least) three ways to fix this problem.  In order of
preference:

1. Ask the author of the RFC to re-license the RFC under a free
   license.  A template for this e-mail request can be found at
   https://wiki.debian.org/NonFreeIETFDocuments

2. Remove the non-free material from the source, e.g., by re-packaging
   the upstream archive and adding 'dfsg' to the Debian package
   version name.

3. Move the package to non-free.

General discussions are kindly requested to take place on debian-legal
or debian-devel in the thread with Subject: "Non-free IETF RFC/I-Ds in
source packages".

Thanks
